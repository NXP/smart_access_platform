# Introduction

This project contains all the source code for the Smart Lock application flashed by default on the SLN-VIZN3D-IOT (minus the proprietary ML/AI engine which is provided as a library binary).

For first time users of the application, it is highly encouraged that you check out the [Getting Started Guide](https://www.nxp.com/document/guide/getting-started-with-the-nxp-edgeready-mcu-based-solution-for-3d-face-recognition:GS-SLN-VIZN3D-IOT).

Once you have successfully reviewed the Getting Started materials, developers should check out the [Software Developer's Guide](nxp.github.io/vizn3d_smartlock_oobe/).
